From 1954 she became a guest singer at the [[Vienna]] State Opera. [[New York]] audience had their first chance to hear the soprano's fine voice in 1960, when she sang there in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]''. Her performance prompted [[Lotte Lehmann]] to call her 'the best Sophie in the world'. [[Herbert von Karajan]] chose her to appear alongside [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]] and [[Sena Jurinac]] for the filmed performance of ''Der Rosenkavalier'' at the Salzburg Festival. \n\nIf she favoured light and high-register lyric parts in the beginning of her career, by the mid-1960s she changed to roles with a stronger dramatic emphasis, including Konstanze (in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail - [[Abduction from the Seraglio]])'', Fiordiligi (in ''[[Cosi fan tutte]])'', Zdenka (in [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Arabella]]'') Marie (in Berg's ''[[Wozzeck]]'') Soeur Constance (in [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]]'s ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Les Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]'') or Violetta in (''[[La Traviata]]'') on stage. She also appeared in many contemporary operas by [[Hans Werner Henze|Henze]], [[Benjamin Britten|Britten]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]], [[Carl Orff]], [[Hans Pfitzner|Pfitzner]], or [[Gian-Carlo Menotti|Menotti]].  She was also a committed singer of [[Lieder]].\n\n==Retirement==\n\nIn the 70's she became a very popular TV entertainer. She retired from the stage in 1983. When her husband died after 45 years of marriage in 1999, she settled on [[Lake Constance]] in [[Switzerland]]. In 2003, she received the ''[[ECHO (music award)|ECHO Award]]'' for lifetime achievement. She wrote an autobiography in 1973: ''Melodie meines Lebens''.\n\n==Recordings==\n\nA large number of complete recordings and highlights discs bear witness to her opera work: (''[[Die Zauberfl\u00f6te]]'' , ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', ''[[Idomeneo]]'', ''[[Arabella]]'', ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'', ''[[H\u00e4nsel und Gretel (opera)|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]'', ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', ''[[La Boh\u00e8me]]'', ''[[La Traviata]]'', or ''[[Martha]]'', and a much-celebrated ''[[The Marriage of Figaro|Die Hochzeit des Figaro]]'').
