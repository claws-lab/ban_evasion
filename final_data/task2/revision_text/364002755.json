Slipknot consists of nine members. The current band members are [[Sid Wilson]], [[Joey Jordison]], [[Chris Fehn]], [[Jim Root]], [[Craig Jones]], [[Shawn \"Clown\" Crahan]], [[Mick Thomson]], and [[Corey Taylor]]. Each member of the band wears a unique [[mask]]. \n\nSlipknot formed in 1995 and underwent several line-up changes following the independent release of their first demo ''[[Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.]]'' in 1996. That album featured original lead vocalist, Anders Colsefini. Their [[Slipknot (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1999, featuring permanent new lead vocalist, Corey Taylor, and was followed by ''[[Iowa (album)|Iowa]]'' in 2001 and ''[[Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)]]'' in 2004. On August 25, 2008, the band returned to release their fourth studio album, ''[[All Hope Is Gone]]'', which debuted at the top spot on the [[Billboard 200]] charts. The band has released three DVDs, including ''[[Disasterpieces]]'', which was certified quadruple-platinum in the United States. Slipknot have sold over 14 million records worldwide.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (1995 &ndash; 1998)===\n{{see also|Mate. Feed. Kill.
