He also drew and wrote the comic strip ''[[The Dropouts]]'' from 1968 to 1981.\n\n===The Dropouts===\n''The Dropouts'' was a [[comic strip]] created by Howard Post and was syndicated by [[United Features Syndicate]] from 1968 to 1981.\n\nThe strip was started, according to Post, as a result of his anger over his adventure strip [[Anthro (comics)|Anthro]] being rejected; the premise of The Dropouts was the classic \"stranded on a desert island\" gag. The two main characters, Alf and Sandy were indeed castaways, but the island they're on is hardly deserted; one of the strips' [[running gag]]s was how closely the natives' society resembled [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. The other characters included a one-man [[police]] force, a doctor, and a chef running a [[cafe]] (his food is inedible); all natives. There were other Western characters, including a religious zealot, an angry feminist, and a dishevelled [[alcoholic]] named \"Chugalug\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{gcdb|type=credit|search=Howard+Post|title=Howard Post}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=creator|id=5138|title=Howard Post}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb name|0692827}}\n\n===Interviews===\n{{morefootnotes|section}}\n*[http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/05post.html Interview with Howard Post]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Post, Howard}}\n[[Category:People from New York]]\n\n[[it:Howard Post]]"}]}}}
