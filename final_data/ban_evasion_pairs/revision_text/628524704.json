Yes, O'Brien \"talked about sex\" before the \"sexual revolution\" but despite how well-known the Philip Larkin poem is as pertaining to this period, it sounds absolutely obtuse to somebody who has not read the poem. While the reference is kind of funny, I strongly feel that Philip Larkin cannot be trust to be some sort of [[Dionysius Exiguus]] as to precisely dating the \"sexual revolution\", unless of course you know of a case where O'Brien mentions the situation herself, as pertaining to the line of the poem. As it stands, Larkin seems to have said nothing about Edna O'Brien's career directly, (and she seems to have said nothing about his. Robinson, Roth, O'Hagan and the others are specifically talking about her career. The fact that Larkin is mentioned at all is because some genius at the Telegraph wanted a good opening.\n\nBesides saying \"three years before the Chatterlay Ban and the Beatles First LP\" sounds to somebody who doesn't know the poem (and evens some who do)...\n\n1. Like it the publication of ''Country Girls'' three years before the expurged publication of ''Lady Chatterlay's Lover'', at which point Ms. O'Brien would have been \"introducing sexual intercourse to Ireland\" at the tender age of negative five years old.\n\n2. Like the expurged publication of ''Lady Chatterlay's Lover'' was the same date as the Beatle's First LP.\n\n3. Like nobody talked about or had sex before Philip Larkin first had sex, a time which he admits was rather late. \n\nThis would be clever writing if it were in a newspaper, or even an academic article, but on Wikipedia, it feels like we're shoe-horning in a reference where it does not belong. I would strongly suggest removing it, if for no other reason than translation. Philip Larkin is largely an Anglo-American phenomena, and Ms. O'Brien's books are still widely translated.\n\nIf you do want to keep it, I would strongly suggest writing at least a rudimentary article about Annus Mirabilis so that everybody who is confused about the reference is simply redirected to the Philip Larkin page and assumes something sexual about his and Ms. O'Brien's relationship (which I'm certain never existed).\n\nP.S. I only slightly edited this on realizing it was a quote from a review. But I stand by what I said. The reference is quite obtuse and there are far better ways about talking about the sociological effect of Ms. O'Brien's writings about sex.\n--[[User:Artimaean|Artimaean]] ([[User talk:Artimaean|talk]]) 01:19, 12 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n:So are you saying you don't mind my deleting the Philip Larkin line?--[[User:Artimaean|Artimaean]] ([[User talk:Artimaean|talk]]) 23:18, 12 January 2013 (UTC)\n\n==Tehrani==\nIndeed.

It is part of the legacy.  He was commander of a police group that went out and acted as a death squad without regard or remorse.  he did not deny it and was pardoned only from prosecution after he turned evidence over to the UN and those investigating war crimes.  I have left off the apartheid reference, but replaced the Vlakplaas reference on his tag line.  He once gave an account of what it was like to barbeque someone on a spit, including the smell of the meat.

Thank you for setting me straight on the Category: Disease-Related Deaths. Now that I understand what it categorizes, it does make sense as a catch-all category.

For instance, I gather statistics on specific causes of death, and the category lists are very useful to me. I just don't know if it's necessary to have such a general category.

Innumerable web sites and almanacs state that Audrey Meadows was born in WuChang, China. Does Ancestry.com automatically trump all other information sources? Is Ancestry.com infallible? I think not.\n\nAlso, Ancestry.com and Wikipedia state that Meadows was born in 1922. If you click on her Find A Grave link, you will see that her gravesite is inscribed with the year 1926.\n\nWe all know that hearsay can be highly unreliable and inaccurate. The ONLY person who can positively verify  Audrey Meadows' place of birth and year of birth is Audrey's mother. If Audrey herself had told you that she was born in New York City, the statement would be hearsay.\n\nNew York City vs. WuChang, China and 1922 vs. 1926. How do you know when you have the truth?

I am planning a future edit in a few days, in which I'll move all of the refs (making them [[WP:LDRHTG|list-defined refs]]) for easier maintenance. Earlier today, I went through all refs in the article to make all date formats consistent, according to one of the acceptable [[WP:DATEFORMAT]] choices (#4 in [[WP:DATEFORMAT|the table]]). You then tweaked some refs to spell out the month, which of course isn't wrong but introduced an inconsistency. So basically, I'm trying to square your edits with the guidelines in [[WP:CITEVAR]] which suggest that internal consistency is important, and we should generally leave well enough alone, rather than impose our style preferences on other editors. Please understand that I'm perfectly OK with generally adopting your style preferences, in order to avoid any inconsistency or conflict over minor matters of style.

[[User:Christian75|Christian75]] ([[User talk:Christian75|talk]]) 23:39, 2 March 2014 (UTC)\n\nNo, [[Paco de Luc\u00eda|Paco]] and [[Pepe de Luc\u00eda]]'s mother, Lucia Gomes, was Portuguese and her surname was Gomes, not G\u00f3mez. Evidently I missed something when I was corrected the surname. Thanks.\n\nYours, [[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com|<font color=\"orange\">'''''Quis separabit?'''''</font>]] 00:13, 3 March 2014 (UTC)\n\n==[[WP:Italics]]/[[Anne Heche]] article==\nHello, Rms125a@hotmail.com. With regard to the Anne Heche article, I can't yet decipher all of what you changed; I'm sure I'll disagree with your definition of \"promotion\" in this case once I do decipher all of it (though I likely won't revert/raise the matter as an issue). But, with regard to using italics for the entire quotes, that violates WP:Italics (which has a Quotations subsection in addition to the other subsections it has, such as with regard to what is appropriate emphasis). [[User:Flyer22|Flyer22]] ([[User talk:Flyer22|talk]]) 16:24, 6 March 2014 (UTC)\n\nAlso, if you reply to me about this, I'd prefer that you reply here at your talk page so that the discussion is kept in one place. [[User:Flyer22|Flyer22]] ([[User talk:Flyer22|talk]]) 16:25, 6 March 2014 (UTC)\n\nOn a side note: Regarding [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_Heche&diff=598415960&oldid=598414595 this], be careful with the word ''claim''; I usually remove that word (plural or not), per [[WP:CLAIM]]. The only reason that I did not remove it from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anne_Heche&diff=598415960&oldid=598414595#Early_life gay father bit] (which was there before your edits to that section today) is because Heche is making a serious/heavy claim about a person. But for Heche stating that she was \"[[insane]] for the first 31 years of her life,\" the word ''claims'' absolutely should not be used. Regarding the messages you left [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Flyer22&diff=598416612&oldid=598416558#Anne_Heche on my talk page], blockquotes are not much better because, per [[WP:Blockquote]], quotes should be a certain length (the length WP:Blockquote specifies) before being put into blockquote. And too many blockquotes can give an article a messy look. As for having split this discussion because you were late to getting my second message above, no worries; I will simply post a [[WP:Permalink]] (a second if required) of this discussion there, which will show the complete discussion. I was able to deduce, from seeing your talk page, that you split discussions; that is what propelled to me to request that you don't split this one.

He was the only non-Catholic. The other non-Catholic parliamentarian was Robert Joshua, the House of Representatives Member for Ballarat, and the leader of the ALP (anti-Communist) in the federal parliament. Joshua was never a member of the Victorian Parliament.

Just because the subject died doesn't mean the article has to be shortened.  The diffs of your edits are very difficult to follow (that's the fault of WP software, not you).  Can you tell me what you think is wrong with the article in terms of content? I see comments like \"POV\", \"OR\", \"cruft\" - what exactly? [[User:Wasted Time R|Wasted Time R]] ([[User talk:Wasted Time R|talk]]) 02:26, 2 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n::: I just restored the deadlink I removed. As far as POV, I would say terms like \"Indeed\" (not in quotes), or \"well known\", rather than just \"known\", depending on the circumstances. Stuff like that. Why don't you compare the diffs and see if the article doesn't look a tad better. If not tell me where I screwed up. Yours, [[User:Rms125a@hotmail.com|<font color=\"orange\">'''''Quis separabit?'''''</font>]] 02:32, 2 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n:::: You don't need to put \"ISBN needed\" on all the short form book cites; its in the long form in each book's first cite.  (Better would be to move those books into a bibliography section.)  You have eliminated what you think are redundant cites but they are actually needed for me to tell what text goes with what cite.  You've put all the quotes in italics; what MoS guideline says to do that?  You've taken the life out of some of the wording: \"In late 1988, Keating began desperate attempts to sell Lincoln\" is based on sources and conveys to the reader much better the feeling of what was happening than \"In late 1988, Keating began attempts to sell Lincoln\".  If the source says it was desperate, why can't we say it was desperate?  That's not \"POV\", that's engaging prose, what articles are supposed to aspire to.  And most of what you've changed I won't even be able to figure out without doing a side-by-side walkthrough of the formatted articles before and after - parts of that big diff are completely unmanageable.  Sigh.  You don't know how many hours I spent researching and writing this one.  What can I say.   [[User:Wasted Time R|Wasted Time R]] ([[User talk:Wasted Time R|talk]]) 02:50, 2 April 2014 (UTC)\n\n::::: No I don't want to revert all your edits.  I just want a change to the culture here where every article is automatically considered unsatisfactory and unmaintained, in need of cleaning up, rearranging, reformatting, cruft removal, etc, all in sweeping edits with little explanation.  And that whenever the subject is in the news it's open season on the article.  Some articles are actually pretty good and had people work really hard to make them that way.  I've been here a long time and of course I know that in WP you get no credit for work done and no credit for knowing a lot about the subject and no credit for having thought a long time about the article and that everything can be redone by others.

There were no ISBN numbers shown on books before somewhere about 1970. The books shown in the references by Tom Truman and Alan Dalziel I think do not have ISBN numbers shown inside their covers because they were published earlier than 1970. An editor with a keen interest on Hungarian-Australians has inserted reference numbers from the National Library of Australia for some books without ISBN numbers. Perhaps I could do this? \n\nAlso two very important references seem to have been removed.

They are both from the same source, but the latter one is an actual document from 1933. If you want to convince me the other one is more reliable, don't waste you time - Close, but no cigar.\nWe should just remove the date altogether. The US Census is far too unreliable. Take [[Janet Waldo]], she was a couple of months old in 1920, 10 in 1930, 16 in 1940, and we still have her as being born 1924. There is a distinct possibility that errors have been made.
