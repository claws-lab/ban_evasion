Although he is best remembered today as the star of the first 'talking picture', ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), he later starred in a series of successful musical films throughout the 1930s. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], he was the first star to entertain troops overseas during [[World War II]]. After a period of inactivity, his stardom returned with ''[[The Jolson Story]]'' (1946). [[Larry Parks]] played Jolson, with the singer dubbing for Parks. The formula was repeated in the sequel, ''[[Jolson Sings Again]]'' (1949). In 1950 he again became the first star to entertain [[G.I.

He died just weeks after returning to the U.S., partly owing to the physical exertion of performing. Defense Secretary [[George Marshall]] afterward awarded the [[Legion of Merit|Medal of Merit]] to Jolson's family. {{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\nAccording to the ''St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture'', \"Jolson was to [[jazz]], [[blues]], and [[ragtime]] what [[Elvis Presley]] was to [[rock 'n' roll]].\" Being the first popular singer to make a spectacular \"event\" out of singing a song, he became a \u201crock star\u201d before the dawn of rock music. His specialty was performing on stage runways extending out into the audience. He would run up and down the runway and across the stage, \"teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience,\" often stopping to sing to individual members; all the while the \"perspiration would be pouring from his face, and the entire audience would get caught up in the ecstasy of his performance.\" According to music historian Larry Stempel, \"No one had heard anything quite like it before on Broadway.\" Author Stephen Banfield agreed, writing that Jolson's style was \"arguably the single most important factor in defining the modern musical....\"<ref name=Showtime/>\n\nHe enjoyed performing in [[blackface]] makeup, a theatrical convention since the mid 19th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, such as jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing [[African-American music]] to white audiences.<ref name=PBS/> As early as 1911 he became known for fighting against black [[discrimination]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Jolson 1916.jpg|thumb|Al Jolson, circa 1916]]\nAl Jolson was born as '''Asa Yoelson''' ({{lang-yi|\u05d0\u05b7\u05e1\u05d0\u05b7 \u05d9\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05e1\u05d0\u05b8\u05df}}) in the [[shtetl|Jewish village]] of [[Sered\u017eius|Srednik]] ({{lang-yi| \u05e1\u05e8\u05e2\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7}}) now known as Sered\u017eius, near [[Kaunas]] in [[Lithuania]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the fifth and youngest child of Moses Reuben Yoelson (1858 \u2013 December 23, 1945) and Nechama \"Naomi\" Cantor (1858 \u2013 February 6, 1895); his four siblings were Rose, Etta, another sister who died in infancy, and Hirsch (Harry). Jolson claimed not to know when he was born, and later chose to celebrate it as May&nbsp;26, 1886.<ref>Freedland, Michael. ''Al Jolson'' (1972), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> His one-time sister-in-law Margie Keeler-Weatherwax (a sister of [[Ruby Keeler]]) claimed Jolson was the same age as their father, who was born in 1882, and that Jolson was 46 when he married the 18 year old Ruby in 1928. In 1891, his father, who was qualified as a [[rabbi]] and [[Hazzan|cantor]], moved to [[New York City|New York]] to secure a better future for his family. By 1894, Moses Yoelson could afford to pay the fare to bring Naomi and his four children to America. By the time they arrived, he had found work at the Talmud Torah Synagogue in the [[Southwest Waterfront, Washington, D.C.|Southwest Waterfront]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], where the family was reunited.<ref>Freedland, pp. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nHard times hit the family when his mother, Naomi, died in early 1895. Following his mother's death, young Asa was in a state of withdrawal for seven months. For a period of time, young Asa spent time at the [[Cardinal Gibbons School|St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys]], a progressive reformatory/home for orphans run by the [[Xaverian Brothers]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] (this was same school once attended by [[Babe Ruth]]. Upon being introduced to show business in 1895 by entertainer [[Al Reeves]], Asa and Hirsch became fascinated by the industry, and by 1897 the brothers were singing for coins on local street corners, using the names \"Al\" and \"Harry\". They would usually use the money to buy tickets to shows at the [[National Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|National Theater]].<ref name=PBS/> Asa and Hirsch spent most of their days working different jobs as a team.<ref>{{cite book |last=Oberfirst |first=Robert |title=Al Jolson: You Ain't Heard Nothin\u2019 Yet |year=1980 |publisher=Barnes & Co |location=London |pp=23\u201340 <!-- ISBN needed --> |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==Stage performer==\n===Blackface===\nIn 1904, while playing an engagement at Keeney's Theatre in Brooklyn, Jolson began performing in [[blackface]].\n\n===Burlesque and vaudeville===\nIn the spring of 1902, he accepted a job with Walter L. Main's Circus. Although Main had hired Jolson as an usher, Main was impressed by Jolson's singing voice and gave him a position as a singer during the circus's Indian Medicine Side Show segment.{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=49\u201350}} By the end of the year, the circus had folded and Jolson was again out of work. In May 1903, the head producer of the [[American burlesque|burlesque]] show ''Dainty Duchess Burlesquers'' agreed to give Jolson a part in one show. Asa gave a remarkable performance of \"Be My Baby Bumble Bee\" and the producer agreed to keep him for future shows. Unfortunately, the show closed by the end of the year. Asa was able to avoid financial troubles by forming a [[vaudeville]] partnership with his brother Hirsch, now a vaudeville performer known as '''Harry Yoelson'''. The brothers worked for the [[William Morris Agency]].{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=50\u201360}}\n\nAsa and Harry soon formed a team with Joe Palmer. During their time with Palmer, they were able to gain bookings in a nationwide tour. However, live performances were falling in popularity as [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon theaters]] captured audiences; by 1908, nickelodeon theaters were dominant throughout New York City as well. While performing in a [[Brooklyn]] theater in 1904,<ref name=JolyM>Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/jolsonbio.htm \"Al Jolson: A Biography\"] Musicals101.com. 2003.</ref> Al decided on a new approach and began wearing [[blackface]] makeup. The conversion to blackface boosted his career, and he began wearing blackface in all of his shows.{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=61\u201380}}\n\nIn the fall of 1905, Harry left the trio following a harsh argument with Al. Harry had refused Al's request to take care of Joe Palmer, who was in a wheelchair, while he was dating. After Harry's departure, Al and Joe Palmer worked as a duo but were not particularly successful. By 1906<ref name=JolyM/> the two agreed to separate, and Jolson was on his own.{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=68\u201370}} Jolson became a regular at the Globe and Wigwam Theater in [[San Francisco, California]], and remained successful nationwide as a vaudeville singer.<ref name=JolyM/> He took up residence in San Francisco, saying the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake]]-devastated people needed someone to cheer them up. In 1908 Jolson, needing money for himself and his new wife, Henrietta, returned to New York. In 1909, Al's singing caught the attention of [[Lew Dockstader]], the producer and star of Dockstader's Minstrels. Al accepted Dockstader's offer and became a regular blackface performer.{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=70\u201381}}\n\n===Broadway playhouses===\n====Winter Garden Theater====\nAccording to ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, \"[[Jacob J. Shubert|J.J. Shubert]], impressed by Jolson's overpowering display of energy, booked him for ''[[La Belle Paree]]'', a musical comedy that opened at the [[Winter Garden Theatre|Winter Garden]] in 1911. Within a month Jolson was a star. From then until 1926, when he retired from the stage, he could boast an unbroken series of smash hits.\"<ref name=Digest>Zolotow, Maurice. [http://jolsonville.com/articles/readers-digest-1949 \"Ageless Al\"], ''Reader's Digest'', January 1949.</ref>\n\nOn March 20, 1911, Jolson starred in his first musical [[revue]] at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City, ''La Belle Paree'', greatly helping to launch his career as a singer. The opening night drew a huge crowd to the theater, and that evening Jolson gained audience popularity by singing old [[Stephen Foster]] songs in blackface. In the wake of that opening night, Jolson was given a position in the show's cast. The show closed after 104 performances, and during its run Jolson's popularity grew greatly. Following ''La Belle Paree'', Jolson accepted an offer to perform in the musical ''[[Vera Violetta]]''. The show opened on November&nbsp;20, 1911 and, like La Belle Paree, was a phenomenal success. In the show, Jolson again sang in blackface and managed to become so popular that his weekly salary of $500 (based on his success in La Belle Paree) was increased to $750.{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=98\u2013117}}\n\nAfter ''Vera Violetta'' ran its course, Jolson starred in another musical, ''The Whirl of Society'', propelling his career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to new heights. During his time at the Winter Garden, Jolson would tell the audience, \"You ain't heard nothing yet\" before performing additional songs. In the play, Jolson debuted his signature blackface character, \"Gus.\"<ref name=JolyM/> The play was so successful that Winter Garden owner [[Lee Shubert]] agreed to sign Jolson to a seven-year contract with a salary of $1,000 a week. Jolson would reprise his role as \"Gus\" in future plays and by 1914 achieved so much popularity with the theater audience that his $1,000-a-week salary was doubled to $2,000 a week. In 1916, ''[[Robinson Crusoe, Jr.]]'' was the first musical in which he was featured as the star character. In 1918, Jolson's acting career would be pushed even further after he starred in the hit musical ''[[Sinbad (musical)|Sinbad]]''.{{sfn |Oberfirst |1980 |pp=123\u2013141}}\n\n{| style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n|[[File:SwaneeCoverGershwinJolson.jpg|thumb|1919 \"Swanee\" sheet music with Jolson on the cover.

Jolson also added another song, \"[[My Mammy]],\" to the show.

Aged 35, Jolson became the youngest man in American history to have a theatre named after him.<ref>Goldman, Herbert G., ''Jolson -\u2013 the Legend Comes to Life'' (1988), Oxford University Press, p. 117.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nBut on the opening night of ''Bombo'', and the first performance at the new theatre, he suffered from extreme stage fright, walking up and down the streets for hours before showtime. Out of fear, he lost his voice backstage and begged the stagehands not to raise the curtains. But when the curtains went up, he \"was [still] standing in the wings trembling and sweating.\" After being physically shoved onto the stage by his brother Harry, he performed and received an ovation that he would never forget: \"For several minutes, the applause continued while Al stood and bowed after the first act.\" He refused to go back on stage for the second act, but the audience \"just stamped its feet and chanted 'Jolson, Jolson', until he came back out.\" He took 37 curtain calls that night and told the audience, \"I'm a happy man tonight.\"<ref>Goldman, p. 118.</ref>\n\nIn March 1922, he moved the production to the larger Century Theater for a special benefit performance to aid injured [[Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America|Jewish veterans]] of [[World War I]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9403E5D71F30EE3ABC4852DFB5668389639EDE&scp=1&sq=Al+Jolson+Bombo+Benefit&st=p \"Benefit Performance: 'Bombo' to Be Given at Century in Aid of Jewish War Sufferers\"] ''New York Times'', March 10, 1922</ref> After taking the show on the road for a season, he returned in May 1923, to perform ''Bombo'' at \"his first love\", the Winter Garden. The reviewer for ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"He returned like the circus, bigger and brighter and newer than ever. ... Last night's audience was flatteringly unwilling to go home, and when the show proper was over, Jolson reappeared before the curtain and sang more songs, old and new.\"<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C10FD3C5416738DDDAC0994DD405B838EF1D3&scp=1&sq=Al+Jolson+Welcomed+Back&st=p \"AL JOLSON WELCOMED BACK.; He Returns to the Winter Garden in \"Bombo\", With New Jokes\"], ''New York Times'', May 15, 1923.</ref>\n\n\"I don\u2019t mind going on record as saying that he is one of the few instinctively funny men on our stage,\" wrote reviewer Charles Darnton in the ''[[New York World|New York Evening World]]''. \"Everything he touches turns to fun.

Jolson\u2019s first film, ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'', for instance, is described by historian [[Michael Alexander (academic)|Michael Alexander]] as an expression of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] music of Jews with the \"imagined music of African Americans,\" noting that \"prayer and jazz become metaphors for Jews and blacks.\" <ref name=\"Alexander, Michael 2003 p. 176\">Alexander, Michael. ''Jazz Age Jews'', Princeton University Press (2003), p. 176.</ref> Playwright [[Samson Raphaelson]], after seeing Jolson perform his stage show ''Robinson Crusoe'', stated that \"he had an epiphany: 'My God, this isn't a jazz singer', he said. 'This is a [[Hazzan|cantor]]!'\" The image of the blackfaced cantor remained in Raphaelson's mind when he conceived of the story which led to ''The Jazz Singer''.<ref name=Norwood>Norwood, Stephen Harlan, and Pollack, Eunice G. ''Encyclopedia of American Jewish History'', ABC-CLIO, Inc. (2008), p. 502.<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref>\n\nUpon the film's release, the first full-length sound picture, film reviewers saw the symbolism and metaphors portrayed by Jolson in his role as the son of a cantor wanting to become a \"jazz singer\":\n:\"Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not. Indeed, I detected again and again the minor key of Jewish music, the wail of the [[Chazan]], the cry of anguish of a people who had suffered. The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u2019s history.\"<ref name=Norwood/> According to Alexander, Eastern European Jews were uniquely qualified to understand the music, noting how Jolson himself made the comparison of Jewish and African-American suffering in a new land in his film ''Big Boy'': In a blackface portrayal of a former slave, he leads a group of recently freed slaves, played by black actors, in verses of the classic slave spiritual \"[[Go Down Moses]].\" One reviewer of the film expressed how Jolson's blackface added significance to his role:\n\n:\"When one hears Jolson's jazz songs, one realizes that jazz is the new prayer of the American masses, and Al Jolson is their cantor. The Negro makeup in which he expresses his misery is the appropriate [[tallit|talis]] [prayer shawl] for such a communal leader.\"<ref name=\"Alexander, Michael 2003 p. 176\"/> Many in the black community welcomed ''The Jazz Singer'', and saw it as a vehicle to gain access to the stage. Audiences at Harlem's Lafayette Theater cried during the film, and Harlem's newspaper, ''Amsterdam News,'' called it \"one of the greatest pictures ever produced.\" For Jolson, it wrote: \"Every colored performer is proud of him.\"<ref>Rogin, Michael.

He enjoyed singing the ''new'' jazz-style of music. Often performing in [[blackface]], especially in the songs he made popular, such as \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\", \"[[My Mammy]]\", and \"[[Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody]]\". Jolson's black stage persona, called \"Gus\" was a wily and wise-cracking servant who was always smarter than his white masters, frequently helping them out of problems they created for themselves. In this way, Jolson used comedy to poke fun at the prevalent idea of \"white supremacy\". In most of his movie roles, however, including a singing [[hobo]] in ''[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum]]'' or a jailed convict in ''[[Say It With Songs]]'', he chose to act without using blackface. In the film ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), he performed only a few songs, including \"My Mammy\", in blackface, but the film is concerned in part with the experience of \"donning a mask\" that the young Jewish singer embraces in performing popular songs onstage. {{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\nAs a Jewish immigrant and America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer, he may have had the incentive and resources to help break down racial attitudes.

This simulation of a stage performance by Jolson was originally presented in a program of musical shorts, demonstrating the [[Vitaphone]] sound-film process. The soundtrack for ''A Plantation Act'' was considered lost in 1933, but was found in 1995 and restored by [[Vitaphone#The Vitaphone Project|The Vitaphone Project]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Eyman|first=Scott|title=The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution, 1926\u20131930|year=1997|isbn=0-684-81162-6|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=98}}</ref> The short was included in Warner's 80th Anniversary release of ''The Jazz Singer'' on DVD.\n\n[[Warner Bros.]] had originally picked [[George Jessel (actor)|George Jessel]] for the role, as he had starred in the Broadway play. When [[Sam Warner]] decided to make ''The Jazz Singer'' a musical with the Vitaphone, he knew that Jolson was the star he needed to put it over. He told Jessel that he would have to sing in the movie, and Jessel balked, allowing Warner's to replace him with Jolson.

But halfway through the 89-minute movie she began to be overtaken by a sense that something remarkable was happening. Jolson's \"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet...\" provoked shouts of pleasure and applause. After each Jolson song, the audience applauded. Excitement mounted as the film progressed, and when Jolson began his scene with [[Eugenie Besserer]], \"the audience became hysterical.\"<ref name=Eyman>Eyman, Scott. ''The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution, 1926&nbsp;\u2013 1930'', Simon and Schuster (1997), p. 129.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nAccording to film historian [[Scott Eyman]], \"by the film's end, the Warner brothers had shown an audience something they had never known, moved them in a way they hadn't expected. The tumultuous ovation at curtain proved that Jolson was not merely the right man for the part of Jackie Rabinowitz, alias Jack Robin; he was the right man for the entire transition from silent fantasy to talking realism. The audience, transformed into what one critic called, 'a milling, battling mob' stood, stamped, and cheered 'Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!'\"<ref>Eyman, p. 140.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the film, Jolson rose from his seat and ran down to the stage. \"God, I think you're really on the level about it. I feel good\" he cried to the audience. Stanley Watkins would always remember Jolson signing autographs after the show, tears streaming down his face. [[May McAvoy]], Jolson's costar remembered that \"[the] police were there to control the crowds. It was a very big thing, like ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''.\" {{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\n====Introduction of sound====\nThe film was produced by Warner Bros., using its new [[Vitaphone]] sound process. Vitaphone was originally intended for musical renditions, and ''The Jazz Singer'' follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound. Jolson's dynamic voice, physical mannerisms, and charisma held the audience spellbound.\n\nCostar [[May McAvoy]], according to author A. Scott Berg, could not help sneaking into theaters day after day as the film was being run. \"She pinned herself against a wall in the dark and watched the faces in the crowd. In that moment just before 'Toot, Toot, Tootsie,' she remembered, 'A miracle occurred. Moving pictures really came alive. To see the expressions on their faces, when Joley spoke to them ... you'd have thought they were listening to the voice of God.'\"<ref>''Berg, A. Scott. ''Goldwyn: A Biography'', Alfred A. Knopf (1998).</ref> \"Everybody was mad for the talkies,\" said movie star [[Gregory Peck]] in a ''Newsweek'' interview. \"I remember '' 'The Jazz Singer,' '' when Al Jolson just burst into song, and there was a little bit of dialogue.

L. ''The Jazz Singer'' (1979), University of Wisconsin Press, p. 23.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nFilm historian [[Scott Eyman]] also describes the cultural perspective of the film: {{quote|[It] marks one of the few times [[Hollywood]] Jews allowed themselves to contemplate their own central cultural myth, and the conundrums that go with it... ''The Jazz Singer'' implicitly celebrates the ambition and drive needed to escape the ''[[shtetl]]s'' of [[Europe]] and the [[ghetto]]s of New York, and the attendant hunger for recognition. Jack, Sam, and Harry let Jack Robin have it all: the satisfaction of taking his father's place ''and'' of conquering the Winter Garden. They were, perhaps unwittingly, dramatizing some of their own ambivalence about the debt first-generation Americans owed their parents.<ref>Eyman, p. 142.</ref>}}\n\n===Other feature films===\n[[File:Heart of NY.jpg|thumb|Poster for ''[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum (film)|Hallelujah, I'm a Bum]]'' with unused title]]\n;''The Singing Fool'' (1928)\nWith Warner Bros., Al Jolson made his first \"all-talking\" picture, ''[[The Singing Fool]]'' (1928) \u2013 the story of a driven entertainer who insisted upon going on with the show even as his small son lay dying, and its signature tune, \"Sonny Boy\", was the first American record to sell one million copies. The film was even more popular than ''The Jazz Singer'', and even though there was still a relatively small number of theaters across the country capable of showing the picture with sound, it held the record for box-office attendance for 11 years, until broken by ''[[Gone With the Wind]]'' a decade later. {{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\nJolson continued to make features for Warner Bros., very similar in style to ''The Singing Fool'', ''[[Say It with Songs]]'' (1929), ''[[Mammy (1930 film)|Mammy]]'' (1930), and ''Big Boy'' (1930). A restored version of ''Mammy'', which includes Jolson in some [[Technicolor]] sequences, was first screened in 2002.<ref>[http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/newsletter/Archive.AprilMay02.pdf UCLA Film and Television Archive Newsletter] April/May 2002.</ref> (Jolson's first Technicolor appearance was in a cameo in the musical ''[[Show Girl in Hollywood]]'' (1930) from [[First National Pictures]], a Warner Bros. subsidiary.) However, these films gradually proved a cycle of diminishing returns due to their comparative sameness, the regal salary that Jolson demanded, and a general shift in public tastes away from the vaudeville-style musical as the 1930s began. As a result of this, Jolson decided to return to Broadway, and starred in a new show, ''Wonder Bar'', which was not very successful.<ref>Oberfirst, pp. 231\u2013235.</ref>\n\n====''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum/Hallelujah, I'm a Tramp''====\nDespite these new troubles, Jolson was able to make a comeback after performing a concert in New Orleans after \"Wonderbar\" closed in 1931. Warners allowed him to make one film with [[United Artists]], ''[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum (film)|Hallelujah, I'm a Bum]]'', in 1933 (the film had to be retitled ''Hallelujah, I'm a Tramp'' in the UK and other English-speaking countries where \"bum\" means \"butt\" and where the slang word for a vagrant is \"tramp\" rather than \"bum\"). It was directed by [[Lewis Milestone]] and written by screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]]. Hecht was also active in the promotion of [[Ben Hecht#Civil rights activism|civil rights]]: \"Hecht film stories featuring black characters included ''[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum]]'', co-starring [[Edgar Connor]] as Al Jolson's sidekick, in a politically savvy rhymed dialogue over [[Richard Rodgers]] music.\"<ref name=Kovan1>Kovan, Florice Whyte.

This new approach worked, sustaining Jolson's movie career until the Warner contract lapsed in 1935. Jolson co-starred with his actress-dancer wife, [[Ruby Keeler]], only once, in ''Go Into Your Dance''. {{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\n====''The Singing Kid'' (1936)====\nJolson's last Warner vehicle was ''The Singing Kid'' (1936), a parody of Jolson's stage persona (he plays a character named Al Jackson) in which he pokes fun at his stage histrionics and taste for \"mammy\" songs\u2014the latter via a number by [[E. Y. Harburg]] and [[Harold Arlen]] titled \"[[I Love to Singa]]\", and a comedy sequence with Jolson doggedly trying to sing \"Mammy\" while The Yacht Club Boys keep telling him such songs are outdated.<ref>Freedland, Michael. ''Jolson - The Story of Al Jolson'' (1972, 2007).</ref>\n\nAccording to jazz historian Michael Alexander, Jolson had once griped that \"People have been making fun of Mammy songs, and I don't really think that it's right that they should, for after all, Mammy songs are the fundamental songs of our country.\" In this film, he notes, \"Jolson had the confidence to rhyme 'Mammy' with 'Uncle Sammy'\", adding \"Mammy songs, along with the vocation 'Mammy singer', were inventions of the Jewish Jazz Age.\"<ref>Alexander, Michael. ''Jazz Age Jews'', Princeton University Press (2003), p. 136.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nThe film also gave a boost to the career of black singer and bandleader [[Cab Calloway]], who performed a number of songs alongside Jolson. In his autobiography, Calloway writes about this episode: {{quote|I'd heard Al Jolson was doing a new film on the Coast, and since [[Duke Ellington]] and his band had done a film, wasn't it possible for me and the band to do this one with Jolson. Frenchy got on the phone to California, spoke to someone connected with the film and the next thing I knew the band and I were booked into Chicago on our way to California for the film, ''The Singing Kid''. We had a hell of a time, although I had some pretty rough arguments with [[Harold Arlen]], who had written the music. Arlen was the songwriter for many of the finest [[Cotton Club]] revues, but he had done some interpretations for ''The Singing Kid'' that I just couldn't go along with. He was trying to change my style and I was fighting it. Finally, Jolson stepped in and said to Arlen, 'Look, Cab knows what he wants to do; let him do it his way.' After that, Arlen left me alone. And talk about integration: Hell, when the band and I got out to Hollywood, we were treated like pure royalty. Here were Jolson and I living in adjacent penthouses in a very plush hotel. We were costars in the film so we received equal treatment, no question about it.<ref>Calloway, Cab. ''Of Minnie the Moocher & Me'', Thomas Y. Crowell Company (1976), p. 131.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref>}}\n\n''The Singing Kid'' was not one of the studio's major attractions (it was released by the First National subsidiary), and Jolson did not even rate star billing. The song \"I Love to Singa\" later appeared in [[Tex Avery]]'s cartoon of the same name. The movie also became the first important role for future child star [[Sybil Jason]] in a scene directed by [[Busby Berkeley]]. Jason remembers that Berkeley worked on the film although he is not credited.<ref name=Fisher103>Fisher, James. ''Al Jolson: A Bio-bibliography'' (1994), p. 103.<!-- publishing info, ISBN needed --></ref>\n\n====''Rose of Washington Square'' (1939)====\nHis next movie\u2014his first with [[Twentieth Century-Fox]]\u2014was ''[[Rose of Washington Square]]'' (1939). It stars Jolson, [[Alice Faye]] and [[Tyrone Power]], and included many of Jolson's best known songs, although several songs were cut to shorten the movie's length, including \"[[April Showers (song)|April Showers]]\" and \"[[Avalon (Al Jolson song)|Avalon]]\". Reviewers wrote, \"Mr Jolson's singing of ''Mammy'', [[California, Here I Come]] and others is something for the memory book\"<ref>Nugent, Frank S., ''New York Times'', May 6, 1939, p. 21.</ref> and \"Of the three co-stars this is Jolson's picture ... because it's a pretty good catalog in anybody's hit parade.\"<ref>Abel. ''Variety''. May 10, 1939, p. 14.</ref> The movie was released on DVD in October 2008. Twentieth Century-Fox hired him to re-create a scene from ''The Jazz Singer'' in the [[Alice Faye]]-[[Don Ameche]] film ''Hollywood Cavalcade''. Guest appearances in two more Fox films followed that same year, but Jolson never starred in a full-length feature film again.\n\n===''The Jolson Story''===\n[[File:JolsonSingerPoster.JPG|thumb|original movie poster, 1946]]\nAfter the success of the [[George M. Cohan]] film biography, ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky believed that a similar film could be made about Al Jolson\u2014and he knew just where to pitch the project. [[Harry Cohn]], the head of [[Columbia Pictures]], loved the music of Al Jolson. Skolsky pitched the idea of an Al Jolson biopic and Cohn agreed. It was directed by [[Alfred E. Green]],  best remembered for the [[Hays Code|pre-Code]] ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]'' (1933), with musical numbers staged by [[Joseph H. Lewis (director)|Joseph H. Lewis]]. With Jolson providing almost all the vocals, and Columbia contract player [[Larry Parks]] playing Jolson, ''[[The Jolson Story]]'' (1946) became one of the biggest box-office hits of the year.<ref>[http://jolsonville.com/2010/02/26/the-jolson-story-opening-review/#more-852 \"The Jolson Story\" review], ''Liberty'', October 19, 1946</ref>\n\nLarry Parks wrote, in a personal tribute to Jolson:<blockquote>\"Stepping into his shoes was, for me, a matter of endless study, observation, energetic concentration to obtain, perfectly if possible, a simulation of the kind of man he was. It is not surprising, therefore, that while making ''The Jolson Story'', I spent 107 days before the cameras and lost eighteen pounds in weight.\"<ref>[http://jolsonville.com/eulogies/by-larry-parks/ \"A Tribute by Larry Parks\"] ''Jolsonville''</ref></blockquote>From a review in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'':<blockquote>\"But the real star of the production is that Jolson voice and that Jolson medley. It was good showmanship to cast this film with lesser people, particularly Larry Parks as the mammy kid... As for Jolson's voice, it has never been better. Thus the magic of science has produced a composite whole to eclipse the original at his most youthful best.\"<ref>''Variety'', September 18, 1946, p. 16.</ref></blockquote>Parks received an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. Although the 60-year old Jolson was too old to play a younger version of himself in the movie, he persuaded the studio to let him appear in one musical sequence, \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\", shot entirely in long shot, with Jolson in blackface singing and dancing onto the runway leading into the middle of the theater. In the wake of the film's success and his WWII tours, Jolson became a top singer among the American public once more.<ref name=pop40t3B/><ref>Oberfirst, Robert, \u2018\u2018Al Jolson: You Ain\u2019t Heard Nothin\u2019 Yet\u2019\u2019 (1980) Barnes & Co., London, p. 311.</ref> [[Decca Records]] signed Jolson and he recorded for Decca until his death.\n\n====Critical observations====\nAccording to film historian Krin Gabbard, ''The Jolson Story'' goes further than any of the earlier films in exploring the significance of blackface and the relationships that whites have developed with blacks in the area of music. To him, the film seems to imply an inclination of white performers, like Jolson, who are possessed with \"the joy of life and enough sensitivity, to appreciate the musical accomplishments of blacks\".<ref>Gabbard, Krin. ''Jammin' at the Margins'' (1996), University of Chicago Press, p. 53.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> To support his view he describes a significant part of the movie:\n<blockquote>\"While wandering around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club where a group of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances ... Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.\"<ref name=Gabbard54>Gabbard, Krin.

A few weeks later, the Jolsons were received by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry Truman]] at the [[White House]]. {{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\n====Radio shows====\nJolson had been a popular guest star on radio since its earliest days, including on NBC's ''[[The Dodge Victory Hour]]'' (January 1928), singing from a New Orleans hotel to an audience of 35 million via 47 radio stations. His own 1930s shows included ''Presenting Al Jolson'' (1932) and ''[[Shell Chateau]]'' (1935), and he was the host of the ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' from 1947 to 1949, with [[Oscar Levant]] as a sardonic, piano-playing sidekick. Jolson's 1940s career revival was nothing short of a success despite the competition of younger performers such as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and he was voted the \"Most Popular Male Vocalist\" in 1948 by a poll in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. The next year, Jolson was named \"Personality of the Year\" by the [[Variety Club]]s of America. When Jolson appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show, he attributed his receiving the award to his being the only singer of any importance not to make a record of \"[[Mule Train]]\", which had been a widely covered hit of that year (four different versions, one of them by Crosby, had made the top ten on the charts). Jolson joked about how his voice had deepened with age, saying \"I got the clippetys all right, but I can't clop like I used to.\" {{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\n====Television work====\nWhen Jolson appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] Los Angeles radio show in 1949 to promote ''Jolson Sings Again'', he offered his curt opinion of the burgeoning television industry: \"I call it smell-evision.\" Writer Hal Kanter recalled that Jolson's own idea of his television debut would be a corporate-sponsored, extra-length spectacular that would feature him as the only performer, and would be telecast without interruption. In 1950, it was announced that Jolson had agreed to appear on the [[CBS]] television network. However, he died before production began. {{cn|date=September 2014}}\n\n==World War II and Korean War tours==\n===World War II===\nJapanese bombs on [[Pearl Harbor]] shook Jolson out of continuing moods of lethargy due to years of little activity and \"... he dedicated himself to a new mission in life....

Finally, [[Louis A. Johnson]], Secretary of Defense, sent Jolson a telegram. 'Sorry for delay but regret no funds for entertainment \u2013 STOP; USO disbanded \u2013 STOP.'

He opened the ears of white audiences to the existence of musical forms alien to their previous understanding and experience ... and helped prepare the way for others who would bring a more realistic and sympathetic touch to black musical traditions.\"<ref name=Crowther/> Black songwriter [[Noble Sissle]], in the 1930s, said \"[h]e was always the champion of the Negro songwriter and performer, and was first to put Negroes in his shows\". Of Jolson's\n\"Mammy\" songs, he adds, \"with real tears streaming down his blackened face, he immortalized the Negro motherhood of America as no individual could.\"<ref>Knight, Arthur. ''Disintegrating the Musical: Black Performance and American Musical film'', Duke University Press (2002).</ref>\n\nHowever, Jolson's signature style, loud and passionate, was soon eclipsed by the cooler and more intimate style of the [[crooners]], singers such as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], who dominated the pop charts in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. While Jolson could and did croon, his basic style was formed in the era when a singer needed to project to the back of a theater with his own physical power; later singers who developed in the microphone era were freed from this constraint.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~lis_fwh/book/roots_of_rock/support/crooner/EarlyCroonersIntro2.htm |title=The Coming of the Crooners |author=Ian Whitcomb |editor=Frank Hoffmann |work=Survey of American Popular Music |publisher=Sam Houston State University |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pitts |first1=Michael |last2=Hoffman |first2=Frank |last3=Carty |first3=Dick |last4=Bedoian |first4=Dick |title=The Rise of the Crooners: Gene Austin, Russ Columbo, Bing Crosby, Nick Lucas, Johnny Marvin and Rudy Vallee |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Deb9AAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Rise+of+the+Crooners:+Gene+Austin,+Russ+Columbo,+Bing+Crosby,+Nick+Lucas,+Johnny+Marvin+and+Rudy+Vallee&hl=en&sa=X&ei=onRiU7CILIq62wWGy4GACQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=The%20Rise%20of%20the%20Crooners%3A%20Gene%20Austin%2C%20Russ%20Columbo%2C%20Bing%20Crosby%2C%20Nick%20Lucas%2C%20Johnny%20Marvin%20and%20Rudy%20Vallee&f=false |accessdate=May 1, 2014 |year=2002 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0810840812}}</ref>\n\nA few of the people and places that have been influenced by Jolson:\n;[[Irving Berlin]]\n:As the movies became a vital part of the entertainment industry, Berlin was forced to \"reinvent himself as a songwriter\". Biographer Laurence Bergreen wrote that while Berlin's music was \"Too old fashioned for progressive Broadway, his music was thoroughly up-to-date in conservative Hollywood.\" He had his earliest piece of luck in the first sound picture, ''The Jazz Singer'', where Jolson performed his song [[Blue Skies (1926 song)|\"Blue Skies\"]],<ref name=Bergreen>Bergreen, Laurence. ''As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin'', Da Capo Press (1996).</ref> the first time a song was ever performed in a feature film. In 1930, he wrote the music for Jolson's fourth movie, ''Mammy'', which included hit songs such as \"Let Me Sing and I'm Happy\", \"Pretty Baby\", and \"Mammy\".\n\n;[[Judy Garland]]\n:Garland had performed a tribute to Jolson in her concerts of 1951 at the [[London Palladium]] and at New York's [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theater]]. Both concerts were to become \"central to this first of her many comebacks, and centered around her impersonation of Al Jolson... performing \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\" in her odd vocal drag of Jolson.\"<ref name=Whitfield>Whitfield, Stephen J., ''In Search of American Jewish Culture'', Brandeis University Press (2001).</ref><ref>[http://jolsonville.com/2010/09/04/a-star-is-born-judy-garlands-comeback ]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\n;[[Bing Crosby]]\n:Music historian Richard Grudens writes that [[Kathryn Crosby]] cheerfully reviewed the chapter about her beloved Bing and his inspiration, Al Jolson. . .where Bing had written, \"His chief attribute was the sort of electricity he generated when he sang. Nobody in those days did that. When he came out and started to sing, he just elevated that audience immediately. Within the first eight bars he had them in the palm of his hand.\"<ref name=Crowther>Crowther, Bruce, and Pinfold, Mike. ''Singing Jazz: The Singers and Their Styles'', Hal Leonard Corp. (1997).</ref> In Crosby's ''[[Pop Chronicles]]'' interview, he fondly recalled seeing Jolson perform and praised his \"electric delivery\".<ref name=pop40t3B/>\n\n:Crosby's biographer Gary Giddins wrote of Crosby's admiration for Jolson's performance style: \"Bing marveled at how he seemed to personally reach each member of the audience.\" Crosby once told a fan, \"I'm not an electrifying performer at all. I just sing a few little songs. But this man could really galvanize an audience into a frenzy. He could really tear them apart.\"<ref name=Giddins>Giddins, Gary. ''Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams'', Back Bay (2002).</ref>\n\n;[[Tony Bennett]]\n:\"My father... took us to see one of the first talking pictures, [[The Singing Fool]], in which Al Jolson sang \"[[Sonny Boy (song)|Sonny Boy]]\". In a way, you could say that Jolson was my earliest influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and [[Eddie Cantor]] on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped into the living room and announced to the adults, who were staring at me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter.\"<ref>Bennett, Tony and Friedwald, Will.

Diamond says it was \"the story of someone who wants to break away from the traditional family situation and find his own path. And in that sense, it 'is' my story.\" In 1972, Diamond gave the first solo concert performance on Broadway since Al Jolson, and starred in the 1980 remake of ''Jazz Singer'', with [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Lucie Arnaz]].<ref>Wild, David.

Lewis's biographer, Murray Pomerance, writes that \"Jerry surely had his father in mind when he remade the film\", adding that Lewis himself \"told an interviewer that his parents had been so poor that they could not afford to give him a bar mitzvah.\" In 1956, Lewis recorded \"[[Rock-A-Bye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody|Rock-A-Bye Your Baby]]\".<ref>Pomerance, Murray.

He started to do Jolson imitations... he was crazy about Jolson.\" Darin's manager, Steve Blauner, who also became a movie producer and vice president of [[Screen Gems]], likewise began his career \"as a little boy doing Al Jolson imitations after seeing ''The Jolson Story'' 13 times ...\"<ref>Evanier, David.
