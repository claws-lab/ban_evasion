Therefore, I believe that the time is ripe for a way to clearly determine consensus. More information can be found in my essay on the topic at [[Wikipedia:Consensus defined]].

Plus, there has to be a large amount of participation for consensus. This is far from merely a votecount, as it requires an in-depth analysis. Admittedly, the large margin provision does have a votecount-style construction, but this is not an absolute percentage and merely a system for determining what level of support constitutes consensus. Furthermore, other criteria not at all dependent on the level of support such as those listed previously are also involved.<p>At worst, the system at least ensures that consensus is determined in a systematic, rather than arbitrary, way. [[User:Wer900|Wer900]] ([[User talk:Wer900|talk]]) 22:41, 18 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n:Anyone who reads the pillar [[Wikipedia:Consensus]] is bound to scratch their head in wonder at the hand waving and magical thinking going on there. As long as the project is operated by an \"Objectivist to the core\", you're going to see magical thinking instead of an honest admission that Administrators are appointed judges who wield enormous power. You can put adjectives like \"benevolent\" in front of \"dictator\", but dictator is the operative word, and benevolence is in the eye of the beholder. It's fine to write reams of advice on how good Admins should make decisions, and I'd be the first to hope that Admins follow good advice and best practices, but in the end they get to do as the please. The saving grace is that their decisions can be appealed, though only to other Admins, who also get to do as they please.<P>Rather than try to obscure the facts about how decisions are made at Wikipedia with a lot of window dressing, it would be better to admit that it's a flawed system that has, so far, happened to have worked pretty well. The system is bound to break down if it ever faces serious stress or an organized effort to subvert it, and then it will be back to the drawing board. Until then, just blithely smile, try not to worry, and edit away. --[[User:Dennis Bratland|Dennis Bratland]] ([[User talk:Dennis Bratland|talk]]) 19:58, 18 March 2012 (UTC)\n::My goal is not gold-plating of a bad system, merely improving the system at its core so that consensus can be determined by a clear process, not by the hand-waving that you yourself pointed out.

You write: \"''The first of these criteria should be to check if there has been a vigorous debate on the subject wherein a large range of points of view have been presented, ranging from absolute support to absolute negation, and where a large number of editors have participated in the debate and provided their opinion.''\". In such case, if everyone holds the same position, there is no consensus by this definition. But that is exactly what consensus (in its purest form) actually is. I'd say that something in your essay has to be revised...<p>A second point is that in most cases consensus ''does'' work. However, those cases are hard to see, because there is little debate, for everyone agrees. That, for example, happens when someone makes a good edit to an article and no one objects. I guess you have tried to create a process that would deal with \"hard cases\", but, well, there is a saying \"[[hard cases make bad law]]\"... You should consider \"easy cases\" as well... --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 01:08, 19 March 2012 (UTC)\n:: Okay, I will revise my essay to include a near-unanimity exception to the first criterion.

Look for cases when consensus was (or was not) found and write down the \"correct\" decision (what the consensus really was - in your opinion). Write detailed explanations. Then look for patterns. Then take a different sample and try to apply the \"laws\" you \"extracted\". Check if the result is reasonable. Then (especially if you won't try to keep the results secret) it will be much easier to write an essay. Hopefully, it will also help to persuade everyone that it is a good one... Or not (if they will disagree with those \"correct\" decisions)... Still, at least that is a honest way to do it... --[[User:Martynas Patasius|Martynas Patasius]] ([[User talk:Martynas Patasius|talk]]) 01:59, 19 March 2012 (UTC)\n::::While I would love a better way to judge consensus, the more I do closes, the more convinced I become that you can not write a book on how to do this.

Or maybe the results of this \"investigation\" (and this discussion, and your essay) will inspire someone else to come up with a good idea? Or maybe you will think of some small improvement? Let's say, some \"process\" for closing AfD discussions - something like 1) check if the discussion is serious (if it is not First of April), 2) have a short look at the article, its history, talk page and AfD discussion, 3) check if no criteria for speedy deletion applies, 4) check if discussion wasn't unanimous, 5) make a list of policies, guidelines and essays that apply, 6) make a list of participants, 7) make a list of arguments, 8) check how those arguments were received by other participants, 9) have a look at the sources given (if any), etc...

Typically, those with the most motivation go on fighting until their opposition grows sick of the endless debate and wearily and wanders off to do something more productive with their time. Or sticks around but says they'll give in because they don't think it's worth it to stay deadlocked forever. So those left behind might agree with each other, but that's only because they've driven off or discouraged dissenters with an excruciating and interminable process.

But in some cases the consensuses process itself is game-able, particularly when the wrongdoers are wiki-saavy.   Especially via. compounding it with other considerations.  For example, one common maneuver is to claim that the opposite view requires a consensus to prevail, whereas going with the perpetrator's view does not. (status quo) Another weak spot is that it basically ends up with one person (the closer) making the decision, which is about the weakest of all possible systems.    <font color =\"#0000cc\">''North8000''</font> ([[User talk:North8000#top|talk]]) 12:13, 19 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n== Simplifying the service of knowledge ==\n\nWe live in a new paradigm of civilization: Twitter, Facebook or Orkut, e-mail. Information travels faster and ever so lean. Several authors point to this. Just remember when certain philosopher speaks of newspaper reports that do not last long. Minute by minute (actually less than that) they are replaced by others - sometimes the very opposite direction. So ... The complexity is gaining ground in the world media, the superimposition of information and, paradoxically, the simplification of this process is the lever. Say as much in less time, to a lesser compatimento, stick to a lesser ... For the time is still money.\nAnyway ... Wikipedia could be tuned to this process. Several issues could be placed on top of that. One is the systematic exclusion of pages created. Could set up a rating system clearer, more explicit, indicating those pages more reliable of the least reliable. However, this system of exclusion, in my opinion, goes against the evolution of Wikipedia.\nAnother thing that has \"fallen\" were rigid paternalistic rules that govern the world. In this sense I see this \"hierarchy\", as was the bureaucracy for businesses, a delay of life. You write something with capital letters and a truly well meaning Wikipedian says capitalized words are like a cry in the Internet. This goes against the uniqueness of people, against their own individuality and mode of production. This authoritarian attitude is, however, own a civilized society, capitalist and interested in the standardization of the actions, thoughts and feelings, making them susceptible to manipulation. If you want to differentiate and say \"this is good, this is bad\", and just think is valid, provided that it is aware that this is an ideological imposition of what is good or bad, elitism and idealism, which I think which, unfortunately, to be necessary. After all I am in favor of idealization. The solution then, for me, is not to exclude, keep the most of all productions. On the other hand continues to tax, categorize, say what is good or bad, after all we are all entitled to it, and I think that Wikipedia too. However it should be repeitar differences.\nIt is an encyclopaedia, not a democracy will mean ...

Your proposal seems to wish to abolish much, if not all, of the restrictions in place on Wikipedia in order to keep up to the pace of a modern, rapidly-changing world.

[[User:Anomie|Anomie]][[User talk:Anomie|\u2694]] 16:52, 23 March 2012 (UTC)\n:::The note I got said that the agency's website would be updated, so I'll just be able to point to that; by the way, I'd overlooked the \"significant new information\" bit.  Not sure that reuploading would be useful, since some of these images were uploaded years ago and deleted months ago.  Incidentally, would it matter if I restore them myself once the agency's website is updated?  I don't think that it would be controversial, but I just feel slightly odd undoing some discussed deletions by myself.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 16:58, 23 March 2012 (UTC)\n::::Yes. IAR and restore them yourself. Clearly the basis for their deletion will have gone away. --[[User:Tagishsimon|Tagishsimon]] [[User_talk:Tagishsimon|(talk)]] 17:18, 23 March 2012 (UTC)\n:::::Just to support this, I don't bat an eye at restoring content that was deleted only for copyright reasons when permission comes in. It doesn't happen ''all'' the time, but not that infrequently. :) --[[User:Moonriddengirl|Moonriddengirl]] <sup>[[User talk:Moonriddengirl|(talk)]]</sup> 19:29, 23 March 2012 (UTC)\n::: If discussion is desired or if the user is unable or unwilling to restore on her/his own, I suggest DRV over REFUND. It's meant for evaluating deletions, and if undeletion is obviously correct and non-controversial, someone will ''speedy restore'' to shortcut [[WP:BURO]].

Something like below 80px perhaps, or lower, and include freely licensed and non-free files here that have no useful purpose?

How is this meant to prevent them from trying. A person can make 10, 20 or even 50 accounts with a single IP. Each account requires a final warning before being blocked. Stealthy vandalism can stay for hours and hours. If an IP does get blocked, they can simply get a new one. Not many vandals/sockpuppetors are scared of a simple block.--[[User:WOLfan112|<font color=\"gold\">User</font><font color=\"green\">WOLfan112</font>]] [[User talk:WOLfan112|<font color=\"blue\">Talk</font>]] 15:35, 25 March 2012 (UTC)\n:Individuals evading an existing block (either by creating one or more new accounts, or by editing while logged out) can be blocked immediately, on sight&mdash;there's no need or requirement to issue one or more warnings in such a case.  Articles which are subject to repeated frequent or particularly insidious vandalism can be [[WP:SEMI|semi-protected]] to prevent editing by logged-out editors and newly-registered accounts.  If you are having difficulty with an individual evading blocks for vandalism, you should be able to get help from an administrator at [[WP:AIV]] or [[WP:ANI]].  To request (semi-)protection of a page, you can go to [[WP:RPP]].

Sending an electric shock to their keyboard? Not likely. It is just a question of wearing them out now. Or once sanity prevails, the implementation of flagged revisions, once again.
