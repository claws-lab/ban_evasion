I know that [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.142.33.37&diff=prev&oldid=480585669 this] probably made you block {{User|AwesomeSponge}} as a sockpuppet of {{User|Spidey665}}. I know both users and I am convinced that they are not the same person. First of all, Spidey665's English seems to be significantly better than AwesomeSponge's (whose English is pretty bad). Secondly, they do not share the same interests, nor have edited similar Wikipedia articles, according to [http://toolserver.org/~pietrodn/intersectContribs.php?wikiDb=enwiki_p&firstUser=AwesomeSponge&secondUser=Spidey665&sort=2 this]. And finally, AwesomeSponge has habits that Spidey do not possess. AwesomeSponge asks for permissions on user talk pages, usually in the form of \"please can you please let me be an admin because i want to...\" without realizing he has to \"earn them\", even once for [[WP:Requests for adminship/AwesomeSponge|adminship]]! I have never seen Spidey do such a thing. AwesomeSponge also seems to show major difficultly in following instructions ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_permissions/Rollback&diff=prev&oldid=476279953 this]). \n\nBecause of what I have explained, I am not convinced that AwesomeSponge is a sockpuppet of Spidey665. What do you think? --<span style=\"text-shadow:#808080 0.2em 0.2em 0.2em\">[[User:Bmusician|<font color=\"blue\">B</font>]][[User talk:Bmusician|<font color=\"#C12267\">music</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Bmusician|<font color=\"grey\">ian</font>]]</span> 04:36, 7 March 2012 (UTC)\n:I was suspicious of AwesomeSponge being a sock of Spidey665 a few days ago. I looked into it, and came to the same conclusion as you did. However, with that first diff, I can only believe that AwesomeSponge, even if he's not a sockpuppet of Spidey665, is trying to create the perception that he is. The bigger question is, \"Is AwesomeSponge a good contributor notwithstanding the potential identity-theft/sockpuppeting?\" I believe the answer to that is no.

Is there any way that former NFL players can be sorted from CFL players that use the same template, and target the NFL guys for automated replacement of the infobox, like we did with \"Infobox NFL retired?\"  Or should I just continue to replace them manually as I find them?  [[User:Dirtlawyer1|Dirtlawyer1]] ([[User talk:Dirtlawyer1|talk]]) 21:09, 22 March 2012 (UTC)\n:::I'm not sure there is a way of sorted like you suggest. Manual is the only way to go with these IMO.

He came back as {{userlinks|Swifty}}, and have been a bit disruptive under that account. I'm trying to figure out the \"compromised account\" story and what credibility it may have.&mdash;[[User:Kww|Kww]]([[User talk:Kww|talk]]) 01:32, 24 March 2012 (UTC)\n:He was disruptive under the JamesAlan1986 account, but not enough to warrant a block. The fact that his boyfriend gained access to his account was enough for a compromised account block, which the boyfriend was requesting anyway [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Worm_That_Turned&diff=prev&oldid=458914681].

I've been a Wikipedia member since about 2005 and editing pages and creating pages since then. I disagree with you by discouraging me from trying.

Yes I would like to continue with my application. {{unsigned|ronjohn}}\n:{{tps}} Having less than 2500 edits is basically an automatic fail.
