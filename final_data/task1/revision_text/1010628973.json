I've subsequently found that a search for the name here: https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results/1950-01-01/1999-12-31?basicsearch=nicholas%20st%20clair&somesearch=nicholas%20st%20clair&retrievecountrycounts=false yielded a couple of results which seem to back up the claim, but I don't have access to the full sources.

We prefer sources that are not behind paywalls, but sources do not have to be free, online, or easily accessible. As long as it can be verified in a published source we are good. See [[WP:PAYSITE]]. If you open a trial account and verify one of the articles' content (the  Birmingham Daily Post is probably the better choice as it mentions the inquest) you are free to cite the newspaper article just like any other news article.

The article is a mess, and does not conform at all or in any way to Wikipedia tradition or style. It's one big advertisement, a pamphlet with quotations taken directly from IB material. I don't think you want that. It's biggest fault is that it uses the jargon of IB, so no normal person can understand the real sense of anything it says. IN addition, it doesn't say anything about the company's income, surplus, business structure - those are things people care about. I added that. I added material with citations, and removed material that was either an ad for the IB or a uncited.

[[User:Meters|Meters]] ([[User talk:Meters#top|talk]]) 20:24, 1 August 2020 (UTC)\n\nHello Meters.\nA pleasure to meet you. You are doing a great job.\nI have not posted anything that is unsourced. I was meticulous, which comes from being in newspapers for 40 years.\n\nThe 23,000 was sourced. Now the 17,000 you've added is old and inaccurate. And the source is secondhand. Why not just use the petition itself, the most reliable source and the original source? \n23,000 has been sourced since day 1. It's also been in the FT, Guardian, Wired, etc, etc. It's not a secret.\nI'm sorry - I don't understand why this becomes an argument, with threats. The goal is an accurate, readable article, If it's about something else let's discuss it.\nThe article is now not well written, lacks clarity, has some grammatical weaknesses and reads like an ad for the IB. Most of all, it's not useful and it's not fair to readers seeking to learn about the IB. It's a waste of time for readers, which is the biggest sin. It's not a wikipedia article - it's a press release. And now the section on grades is not accurate.\n\nAlso, why are you even editing it? I mean why does this section \"have to do with you\", and not the others? I wrote the original article, not you. You could better spend your energy cleaning up the PR hogwash the makes up 90% of the page, instead of editing the only readable thing on the page. There was no reason to touch it - it was all sourced.<!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Sterlinggranger|Sterlinggranger]] ([[User talk:Sterlinggranger#top|talk]] \u2022 [[Special:Contributions/Sterlinggranger|contribs]]) 22:25, 1 August 2020 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n\n:Yes, you certainly did add an inaccurate unsourced statement. You said that the petition had received more than  '''23,000''' signatures '''by July 7'''. That was unsourced, and it is not correct. The original source said 1,500 signatures by that date, and the newer, more reliable source I added said 17,000 signatures by July 13. If you want a more recent value then add a newer source. to that claim.\n:As for why I am editing it, it does not matter. The IB grade issue has absolutely nothing to do with me. In fact, if it does have something to do with you you might want to read [[WP:COI]]. And who wrote the material is irrelevant (II am assuming that you meant that section rather than the entire article). Please read [[WP:OWN]]. You do not own the content.

You left a msg concerning some changes regarding a Leap Year page coming from the IP of a member of my household. This person is Autistic. I have left messages before (much easier), about this situation as it\u2019s very emotional.

Don\u2019t make it so difficult to contact you, along with such complicated rules. I chastise you for being supercilious and impolite.

All you had to do was post to my talk page. It's '''not''' currently protected.

And why this page starts off with \"'''Do not post here unless you have first unsuccessfully attempted to post to my main talk page.'''\" and continues with \"Really. If my main talk page is unprotected I probably will not see or reply to any posts here.\" and then \"This page is for the use of unconfirmed users in the event that my regular talk page has been temporarily protected and they are unable to post to it.\" I really don't know how I can make it any more obvious. For that matter, even if my talk page were protected, as an established editor you would still have been able to post to it. Or you could have pinged me to a different talk page, or even emailed me. There is absolutely nothing I can do to make it any easier for other editors to contact me.\n#I didn't assume ill intent and I wasn't unkind. I simply undid the edit with a summary explaining why. I left a canned, polite level 1 disruptive (not vandalism) editing message after the IP made the same edit a second time, pointing them to [[WP:BRD]]. If you don't like the term \"argue the point\" then please read it as \"discuss the point\". And I said nothing about having a final say. Calling me \"supercilious and impolite\" and accusing me of harassing the IP is a personal attack by you. See [[WP:NPA]].\n#I, and any other editors who have been involved in this (I see from you edit history that this has been going on since at least 2017), have no way of knowing that an anonymous dynamic IP is being used by someone with autism.

And the \"Good luck\" was irony because I think you will have zero success in trying to \"move this issue up the channel\".

You messaged me saying that my reference for [[Ron Howard]] producing [[Vibes]] was wrong (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096378/fullcredits), that it doesn't mention him. Please check again, it very clearly mentions Ron Howard as an executive producer. His name is the fourth in the list in the section \"Produced By\". If you could please verify that I am telling the truth, and re-instate my edit, that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNever mind, I went ahead and re-edited it, but now with four references supporting the fact that Ron Howard of Imagine Entertainment was executive producer of Vibes. I hope four is enough? If not, his name is literally on the poster for the movie, which is the one image in the article. Surely the poster qualifies as a credible source, right?\n\nAnyway, although in this case you were maybe a little to quick to assume that an edit was bad, I appreciate your efforts to make wikipedia rigorous. Thank you!\n:Already answered on your page. We don't list executive producers in the \"Producers\" field. And why would we add just one of the additional names even if we did? [[User:Meters|Meters]] ([[User talk:Meters|talk]]) 00:00, 14 August 2020 (UTC)\n\nOk, I see, I did not know this about the info box. But surely it's worth including the fact that Ron Howard (executive) produced the film later in the article, right?\n:Please indent and sign your talk page posts.\n:Again, why would we mention just him and not any of the others? [[User:Meters|Meters]] ([[User talk:Meters|talk]]) 00:07, 14 August 2020 (UTC)\n\n:: Sorry, like most people, I'm not an expert at editing Wikipedia. I hope you can cut me some slack. I'm not trying to make \"disruptive edits\", I'm just trying to include legit, sourced information that is pertinent to an article. Surely putting someone's name in the wrong spot shouldn't warrant a the threat of a ban, should it? Anyway, as to your question (why mention *just* Ron Howard and not any of the others?), my answer is: the other producers can be included, I'm not in anyway trying to prevent their names from being mentioned, though he is the only \"executive\" producer, so he is clearly distinct from the others, in some way; however, out of all the producers, he is extremely noteworthy (I assume you know who Ron Howard is), so I figure if any of the executive/co-/associate producers are to be mentioned in an article for a movie they made, at the very least Ron Howard's name should be one of them. Because he's really really famous. If the only way to let the world know the truth about Ron Howard's association with Vibes is to also include the other people's names, then I will happily add them in. I just figured somebody would take care of that if they felt it was necessary (please excuse me for being a little lazy). Thank you!

I sent a request for repression and I was told by Kevin Li that the page violates the biographies of living persons rule, but it did not rise to a level requiring suppression and to monitor it. \n\nThe edit violates your rules about neutrality, verifiability, primary sources, circular reporting, victimization, gossip, and people who are relatively unknown.\n\nThe information contained there is both incorrect and part of a campaign by individuals who have been stalking and harassing me for years with racist motivations. The nuisance suit was filed in an attempt to stop me from my anti-racism activism work. The allegations were not proven in court, and the University of Toronto Students' Union eventually put out a statement saying that they regretted the proceedings and inflammatory public comments made. It does not rise to the level of \"scandal\".\n\nI am not permitted to discuss specifics of the suit as a condition of a negotiated settlement. Regardless, I can say the following about the information contained in that section of the page about me:\n\n(1) it references \"embezzlement,\" which never came up in the case and is factually incorrect\n(2) it states that it was alleged that I destroyed relevant information including the total number of hours I worked during my employment. This is untrue and not provided for in the source. All documentation regarding my hours worked were provided in discovery, and I still have copies of them.\n(3) it cites a secondary source that is tabloid in nature (a student paper; which I understand is typically trustworthy, but this particular paper at this particular time in the students' union history had personal relationships with the people it would write negative stories about). The original writer of the student source did not disclose that she was in a romantic relationship with one of the students who filed the suit.\n(4) The tabloid source incorrectly references only one primary source (the complaint-side pleading documents; it does not at all use the response-side pleading documents)\n(5) the other sources referenced amount to circular reporting (they all reference the one initial student paper source).\n(6) The section states that  I \"corrected [my]self and noted that the case was not racially motivated and UTSU had reasonable basis to sue [me].\" This is false. The UTSU put out a statement saying that, but I do not engender such feelings. The source is the student press, and they never spoke to me about this case at all. This is an example of a tabloid source (the student press) using a self-published source (the UTSU's statement) as fact.\n\nI am relatively unknown by Wikipedia's standards and it seems strange that there is a section of this page titled \"Scandal\" for an issue that is no more a part of my life or what I am known for than the several other harassment legal documents filed against me as a result of my anti-racist activism.\n\nThis one-sided and incorrect information appears as the largest section on the page, and not, for example, that I was the first Black woman to serve as the President of Canada's oldest students' union, that I was the first Black person to serve as Chair of the Canadian Federation of Students - Ontario, that I was intimately involved with the removal of police from the largest school board in North America, and other such items, seems like the work of someone trying to defame me. I am not arguing that those things should be added, but this section being the largest thing written\nabout me on wikipedia appears to be the work of a long, ongoing libel/defamation campaign.  <!-- Template:Unsigned IP --><small class=\"autosigned\">\u2014&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/2605:E000:151D:87F:C854:6313:8D22:BC54|2605:E000:151D:87F:C854:6313:8D22:BC54]] ([[User talk:2605:E000:151D:87F:C854:6313:8D22:BC54#top|talk]]) 09:27, 9 September 2020 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->\n:Why is this on my page?

You can take this up on the article's talk page if you  want to get more input, but I would suggest that your time would be  better spent looking for a better source for the actual claim rather than worrying about the details of who published it.

I am sorry that you agree with the deleting editor regarding my 2 entries in the Notable person list as not being notable.\n\nThe fact they were local Balmain residents who founded and owned one of Australia's largest industrial conglomerates, are included in the \nAustralian Dictionary of Biography, one received a Knighthood for services to Australian shipping, in 1971 built the largest ship made in Australia up to that time etc. etc.\n\nIf editors don't believe the above residents qualify as notable, but unknown activists and little known journalists do, then this is more damaging to Wikipedia than someone calling out an editor for their political ideology.\n\nThe fact that sources of notability are disregarded, and the subject is deleted solely because it is a red link goes against Wikipedia's own advice. \n\n\"In general, a red link should be allowed to remain in an article if it links to a term that could plausibly sustain an article, but for which there is no existing candidate article, or article section, under any name.\"                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Red_link\n                                                                                                    \n[[User:Theirishslave|Theirishslave]] ([[User talk:Theirishslave|talk]]) 23:17, 13 November 2020 (UTC)\n:{{re|Theirishslave}} It's a good idea to link to the article in question ([[Balmain, New South Wales]]) or provide a link to the edit in question [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Balmain,_New_South_Wales&diff=988446643&oldid=988446471].\n:Well thanks for the message. I usually get a laugh when an editor (or better yet an SPA) with almost zero Wikipedia edits thinks they should explain something to me. \n:There is a big difference between a person being mentioned in general prose in an article versus a notables list (even if that list happens to be formatted as prose rather than as a bulleted list). The first is someone who is already being mentioned in the article (because they have something to do with the topic of the article), while the latter is someone who is being mentioned specifically '''because they are notable''',  and they happen to have some connection (sometimes minor) to the subject in common with the other list members. We are generally fairly concerned about not letting lists of notable people degenerate into lists of red links for which articles may not be justified or which may never be written. You linked to [[WP:REDLINK]] (and <nowiki>[[WP:REDLINK]]</nowiki> is how to format that link properly). Did you actually read it? If so you must have missed the portion that discusses this issue:\n:<blockquote>Lists of \"notable people\" in an article, such as the \"Notable alumni\" section in an article on a university, tend to accrue red links, or non-links, listing people of unverifiable notability. Such list entries should often be removed, depending on the list-selection criteria chosen for that list.</blockquote> \n:My approach to this is to not accept red links in lists of notable people unless the person would clearly qualify for an article if one were written, and there are reliable sources to show that the person meets whatever other list inclusion criteria exist. Consensus has established criteria for when a person's notability can be presumed. See [[WP:BIO]] and the various linked essays. I'm not aware of any consensus that mere inclusion in the \"Australian Dictionary of Biography\" is sufficient to presume notability. Please point me to the discussion if you know of one.\n\n:Here's my take on this. You have been edit warring to include these red-linked entries for more than three years. You have been making personal attacks on the other edit for more than three years. You have never taken this to the article's talk page to discuss the potential notability of the people in question. You have not discussed this with the other editor for more than three years, at which time your arguments consisted of such less than compelling statements, based on your personal knowledge, as: \"they were held in high esteem by Balmain locals\". \"Sir Rod was a regular down at the sailing club\", and \"Good people\". [[user:Doctorhawkes]] responded with \"Unfortunately, they don't appear to be notable. ...\" You then attacked him and the next response was \"I have no ideology. If you believe that they are notable, trying writing an article for them and they will be judged against Wikipedia's notability guidelines.\"  And yet you show up on my page to discuss it and make a further attack on the editor after I make one edit? If you had simply attempted to write the articles or discuss this on the article's talk page this would have long since been settled.\n:As for the actual  content, one of them is likely notable, and one of them does not even have a source showing his connection the town. There was a third entry in earlier edits (before my involvement) but I don't remember what I though of him,and I've spent more than enough timer on this.

[[User:Meters|Meters]] ([[User talk:Meters#top|talk]]) 19:30, 11 January 2021 (UTC)\n\na) yes I am, admittedly, one of the brothers. But the notability of the group speaks for itself and as you said, the notability of the group is verifiable. \nb) Both James Abrams and John Abrams (myself) graduated from Queen's University and La Salle Secondary School, and the truth of this is verifiable through various sources. The band's success is collective. Each of the individual's notability in this case is inextricably intertwined with the other's. Could you kindly let me know how then to add the group \"The Abrams\" to the list, without the need for individual pages on each member of the group? Would it, for instance, be best to list them each individually, i.e. \"John Abrams, member of The Abrams...\" and \"James Abrams, member of The Abrams...\" in two separate lines? [[User:JohnAbrams23|JohnAbrams23]] ([[User talk:JohnAbrams23|talk]]) 19:38, 11 January 2021 (UTC)JohnAbrams23\n:No, making individual entries for each brother with both entries simply linking or redirecting to the group does not change anything. Alumni lists are for notable alumni. The group is notable, but the group is not an alumnus, and the members are not notable simply because the group is notable. See [[WP:WTAF]], but '''you''' should not be the person to write the articles. See [[WP:COI]]. You have  a conflict of interest in writing about you or your brother or your group. Even adding mention of your group to your hometown as you did at [[Kingston]] is somewhat questionable. If you have no interest in Wikipedia other than to mention your group, your brother, and yourself you probably should not be here.

I happened to check that one since I noticed a new alumnus being added. You didn't provide a source for his attendance, and his article does not mention the school, so I tagged the entry as needing a source. That you claim to know that he attended doesn't help. No offense, but people sometimes mistakenly or falsely claim that notable people attended their high schools. The broken link you provided above does not help either. Even if the link had worked I would not consider it to be a very good source. Same comment for a hypothetical picture of his diploma. All that would show is that someone of that name attended, not that the subject of this article attended. Since I can put the subject in San Jose as a teenager I would likely leave such an entry in but tag it with \"Better source needed\". Other editors might not leave it in at all, and I would not restore it myself if someone did choose to take it out.

While I can understand the revert of unreferenced material, and while \"notable alumni\" spam is indeed all too common... the IP is right in this case.  It's straightforward to reference Beto as a Woodberry alum, e.g. this Dallas Morning News summary <ref>{{cite web |title=Points from the trail |url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/02/19/beto-o-rourke-s-high-school-past-trump-s-chances-in-2020-blackface-at-ut-laura-miller-s-return/ |website=Dallas morning News |access-date=4 February 2021}}</ref>; in the reference, there's also a link to a deeper dive from the DMN's Washington correspondent, who visited Woodberry.  \n\nBeto should definitely be in notable alumni section.

I would also like to let you know that there is no malicious intent or vandalism in the things I have done these past few days. I am an 8th grade English teacher and my students are starting their research essay unit. One of the key components is finding reliable websites. Every year I make minor changes to a known wiki page (that I immediately change back after the lessons) to show my students that, at times, Wikipedia can be unreliable. Your messages have added to my lesson so I say thank you and have a good day. \ud83d\ude01 [[User:ThoseGuys1980|ThoseGuys1980]] ([[User talk:ThoseGuys1980|talk]]) 13:28, 6 March 2021 (UTC)"}]}}}
